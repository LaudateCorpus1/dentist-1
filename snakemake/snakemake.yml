# You may provide default values for environment variable. They will only be
# used if the variable is undefined in the current environment.
#default_env:
#    TMPDIR: /home/user/tmp

# You may also override values in the environment.
#override_env:
#    LANG:   C


# --- Environment variables substitution ---
#
# Environment variables may be referenced in the config via `$VARNAME` or
# `${VARNAME}`; to get a literal dollar sign use `$$`. Values in `deafult_env`
# `override_env` are expanded with the unmodified environment.
#
# Beware, if using environment variables in `dentist_config` the data type
# must be correct, e.g. you cannot pass `read-coverage` be environment
# variable because it will be a string but a float is expected. Still, if you
# specify values via `env` in the config then they will keep their data type,
# so the following will work:
#
#     override_env:
#         COV: 30.0
#     dentist_config:
#         __default__:
#             read-coverage: $COV
