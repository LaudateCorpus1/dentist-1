DENTIST Release Guide
=====================

![Document State: in progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/State-in_progress-important?logo=markdown)

This document describes the steps to take when preparing a new release.

## Quality Control

The following requirements must be met before creating a release:

1. The `develop` branch is checked out and the repo is in a clean state, i.e.
   `git status` is empty but for irrelevant untracked files.

2. The code compiles with `dub build`.

3. The pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`) triggered by `git push internal`
   succeeds. It includes a check for broken links, syntax check of the
   workflow and unit tests. Simply execute by pushing the `develop` branch.

4. Build Docker image with `docker build -t dentist:edge .`. This may take a
   while â€“ go drink a coffee.

5. The example finishes successfully:
    
    ```sh
    # prepare example
    cd ../dentist-example
    # add the local repo if it is not yet a remote
    #git submodule foreach 'git remote add local "$(realpath "$PWD/../../../dentist")"'
    # update dentist submodule to latest develop
    git submodule foreach 'git fetch local && git checkout -f local/develop'
    # derive singularity image from Docker image
    make -B dentist_edge.sif
    # exhaustive tests using Singularity and pre-compiled binaries
    # go take a break (takes about 20min)
    make DENTIST_VERSION=edge test
    # reset dentist submodule
    git submodule update
    ```


## Prepare DENTIST release

The following steps must be taken to prepare the DENTIST release locally:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` (include correct version) and
   `git commit -m 'Updated CHANGELOG' CHANGELOG.md`.

2. Bump version number with `./bump-version.sh`.

# ------------------------------- continue here -------------------------------
3. Make release tarball and Docker image with `./make-release.sh`.

4. Verify correct software version with `docker run --rm a-ludi/dentist:vX.Y.Z`

5. Update `master` branch using `git checkout master && git merge --ff develop`

6. Update GitHub Page:

    ```sh
    git checkout gh-pages
    git checkout -f develop .
    ...
    ```

99. To be continued... (... update git branches)


## Prepare example release

## Publish new DENTIST release

The following steps must be taken to publish the prepared DENTIST release:

1. Push code changes to internal repository; this trigger the pre-push hook
   which MUST succeed.

    ```sh
    git push internal develop master $(git tag --list 'v*')
    ```

2. Go ahead an check the internal repository website and see if everything is
   in order.

3. Push code changes to public repository:

    ```sh
    git push public develop master $(git tag --list 'v*')
    ```

4. Go to [GitHub Tags](https://github.com/a-ludi/dentist/tags) and create a
   release for the newly pushed tag. Just copy everything from the tag
   annotation/CHANGELOG.

5. What about the example?
